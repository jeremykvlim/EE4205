# EE4205

Notes for [EE4205 Quantum Communication and Cryptography](https://nusmods.com/courses/EE4205/quantum-communication-and-cryptography), AY23/24 Semester 2. Taught by Dr. Marco Tomamichel with research fellow Enrique Cervero as his teaching assistant.

This is a very theroetical course. In fact, I see no reason why it is labelled as EE rather than MA given that it is almost all pure mathematics. If you have poor linear algebraic skills, I do not recommend taking this course. Additionally, it is highly advised to take this with some prior knowledge of cryptography and quantum mechanics. A majority of the material is taught without contextual explanations under the assumption that you are already aware of how things should operate in quantum systems, and also what cryptanalytical goals should be met by quantum protocols.

The class enrollment was 12, which later fell to 10 once 2 people withdrew by the third week. Of the 10 people who remained, 3 were postgraduates and 1 was a guest student. Due to the small class size, this course is not bell curved. Every class is held in-person, and there are no recordings to watch back on.

Grading scheme:

* 60% from open-book final exam
* 20% from 4x in-class unannounced open-book quizzes (students are highly incentivised to attend all classes in case the quiz is on that date, and also expected to be up to date with course material at all times)
* 20% from homework (6 homework assignments of 20 marks each, released on a fortnightly basis, but you can only claim up to 100/120 marks in total; fret not, hardly anyone even reaches this threshold as the homework difficulty is insane - the average was 12/20 for one of the easier assignments)
